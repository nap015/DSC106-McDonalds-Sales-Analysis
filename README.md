# Introduction

For the past few years, McDonald's burger sales have been increasing steadily, indicating a positive growth.
While this shows that our products continues to be popular among our customers, there is a need for us to analyze our past
accomplishments and suggest any possible improvements we could make to further stabilize our #1 status in the fast food market.

# Long-term Analysis

The following data will go over our monthly sales data (in USD) from January 2016 to our most recent data from September 2019, covering
all of the states. The sales data will be divided by two categories: the type of menu (Hamburger, Chicken Fillet, Fish Fillet),
and the broader region for each of these sales (Northeast, Southeast, Central, Northwest, Southwest).

## Competitor Influence

In October 2018, our strongest competitor **Burger King** released the **Impossible Burger**, 
a _vegetarian_ option for their signature menu, the Whopper.

The following graph charts show that after the release of the Impossible Burger, our overall sales took a critical blow of **14.1%**;

Hamburger sales dropped **14.4%** (from 7.9M USD to 6.8M),

Chicken Fillet sales dropped **14%** (from 3.3M to 2.9M),

and Fish Fillet sales dropped **13.3%** (from 2M to 1.7M). 


Although many different factors should be considered for this decrease in sales and there has been a slight, consistent decrease in Hamburger sales from September to October in the past years ranging from 2.1% (2016) to 2.5% (2017), it is observable that the Impossible Burger has a significantly negative effect on our sales.

## Solution

Currently, McDonalds does not offer any vegetarian/vegan burger options in the United States, even though we have such options like the [**McVegan**](https://www.today.com/food/mcdonald-s-testing-vegan-burger-finland-t117145), which is available for customers abroad
and gained high popularity. 
I suggest that we expand the sales of McVegan burgers to the U.S. to attract potential customers and sway them from our competitor's vegetarian burgers. 
Another crucial advantage of the McVegan is that this burger is _vegan_ as its name suggests, whereas the Impossible Burger is only _vegetarian_ because it contains mayonnaise. This means that if the McVegan is also sold in the States, it will not only attract vegetarian but also vegan customers. 
It is estimated by the [Vegetarian Times](https://www.vegetariantimes.com/uncategorized/vegetarianism-in-america) that about 1 in every 7.3 vegetarians have a vegan-only diet, suggesting we could have up to an additional 15.9% influx of customers (compared to consumers of the Impossible Burger) with the inclusion of the McVegan on our menu.

# Short-term Analysis

The following data will go over our daily sales data (in USD) from January 2016, covering all of the states. 
The sales data will be divided again by two categories: the type of menu and the broader region for each of these sales.
This time, we will explore if there are any discrepancies between the sales depending on the day of the week, or the time of the month
that the purchases were made.

## Sales Comparison Based on Day of Week

The data was aggregated as an average per day of week instead of the sum since certain days (Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays) occur more often than others in this month.

The 1st graph shows that there is no significant difference for each day of the week when observing just the overall trend.
However, when looking closely, we can observe that each region has different sales trend depending on the day of the week.

For instance, the Northeast region experiences a boom in sales for every Thursdays and Sundays, while the Southwest and Central regions
show a steep increase for every Fridays and Mondays.
