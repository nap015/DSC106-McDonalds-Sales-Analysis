# Introduction

For the past few years, McDonald's burger sales have been increasing steadily, indicating a positive growth.
While this shows that our products continues to be popular among our customers, there is a need for us to analyze our past
accomplishments and suggest any possible improvements we could make to further stabilize our #1 status in the fast food market.


# Long-term Analysis

The following data will go over our monthly sales data (in USD) from January 2016 to our most recent data from September 2019, covering
all of the states. The sales data will be divided by two categories: the type of menu (Hamburger, Chicken Fillet, Fish Fillet),
and the broader region for each of these sales (Northeast, Southeast, Central, Northwest, Southwest).

## Competitor Influence

In October 2018, our strongest competitor Burger King(referred as 'BK' from now on) released the Impossible Burger.

# Short-term Analysis

The following data will go over our daily sales data (in USD) from January 2016, covering all of the states. 
The sales data will be divided again by two categories: the type of menu and the broader region for each of these sales.
This time, we will explore if there are any discrepancies between the sales depending on the day of the week, or the time of the month
that the purchases were made.

## Sales Comparison Based on Day of Week

The data was aggregated as an average per day of week instead of the sum since certain days (Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays) occur more often than others in this month.
The 1st graph shows that there is no significant difference for each day of the week when observing just the overall trend.
However, when looking closely, we can observe that each region has different sales trend depending on the day of the week.
For instance, the Northeast region experiences a boom in sales for every Thursdays and Sundays, while the Southwest and Central regions
show a steep increase for every Fridays and Mondays.
